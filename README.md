## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I want to investigate the AirBnB dataset from Seattle to answer the following questions:

1.How much is the average price of different room types, property types, and neighborhoods in Seattle data and which amenities are provided by the host in more expensive listings?

2.How different features of a listing can be related to the review scores left by customers?

3.How different features can be realted to predict the price of a listing based on the data modeling results?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
